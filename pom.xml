       Configure where should Maven look for other libraries and plugins we
       want to use in our plugin. Those libraries and plugins can you then
       reference below in the dependencies section.

       Each repository has two parts - the id and url. The id does not
       really matter, however the URL must contain a valid Maven repository
       where the dependency is "installed" (that's why we call the goal "install"
       because we want to install our plugin on our PC as well so that we can
       use it in our other plugins together without linking it as a dependency)

       By default we use the Spigot repository for Spigot and the central Maven
       repo for many other plugins.
